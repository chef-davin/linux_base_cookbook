# linux_base

This is just a basic cookbook for doing some things on linux systems that I'm writing in order to demonstrate my capabilities as a cookbook author.

Task 1:

1. Make sure NTP is installed, enabled and started.
2. Add DNS entries to `/etc/resolv.conf` for something generic like Google.
3. Make sure cups service is disabled.
4. Set system time to UTC timezone for eastern
5. Inspec tests for all the above.
