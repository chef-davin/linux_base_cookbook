# linux_base

This is just a basic cookbook for doing some things on linux systems that I'm writing in order to demonstrate my capabilities as a cookbook author.

## Task 1

1. Make sure NTP is installed, enabled and started.
2. Add DNS entries to `/etc/resolv.conf` for something generic like Google.
3. Make sure cups service is disabled.
4. Set system time to UTC timezone for eastern
5. Inspec tests for all the above.

## Task 2

### In the same cookbook, I would like you to

1. Install an apache server
2. Configure it for https
3. Create a hello world page with timestamp for creation date.
4. MISC. Add some sort of personal flare to the site using a resource you haven't used in the cookbook yet.

  I'd like to see inspec for all of these as well
